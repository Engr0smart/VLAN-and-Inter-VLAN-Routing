- Configure the links between the switches as trunk
SW1
conf t
int g0/1
switchport mode trunk

SW2
en
conf t
int g0/1
switchport trunk encap dot1q
switchport mode trunk

int g0/2
switchport trunk encap dot1q
switchport mode trunk

SW3

- Configure VTP. SW1 as VTP server. SW2 as transparent so as not to synchronize with SW1 VLAN database. SW3 must learn VLAN information from SW1 VLAN database.
SW1

SW2
conf t

SW3

You can use sh vtp status to verify each of the switch vtp status

- Configure VLAN on the switches
VLAN 10 - Tech
VLAN 20 - Sales

SW1 & SW2
conf t
vlan 10
name Tech
vlan 20
name Sales
vlan 199
name Native
exit

- Configure the ports connected
SW1
int range f0/1-2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
int f0/3
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
end

SW3
int f0/3
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
int range f0/1-2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20

SW3 will automatically learn the VLAN information from SW1 because of the vtp configuration. So we don't have to configure VLAN on SW3

Use show vlan brief to verify

- Configure the trunk links to use VLAN 199 as the native VLAN for better security

SW1
int g0/1
switchport trunk native vlan 199

SW2
int g0/1
switchport trunk native vlan 199
int g0/2
switchport trunk native vlan 199

SW3
int g0/2
switchport trunk native vlan 199

- Verify connectivity between PCs in the same VLAN. You can ping Tech2 and Tech3 from Tech1. Do the same for Sales VLAN PCs.
NB: Tech VLAN PCs will not have connection with Sales VLAN PCs because we are yet to configure inter-VLAN routing which would enable layer 3 communications.

Inter-VLAN Routing
We are going examine the three options in this lab.

Option 1 - Separate Interfaces on Router
- On R1, configure interfaces fa0/0 and fa0/1 as default gateways for the Tech and Sale PCs respectively

int f0/0
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

int f0/1
ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

- On SW2, configure the interfaces to support inter-VLAN routing
int f0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
int f0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20

- Verify there is connectivity between the two VLANs

Option 2 - Router on a stick
- Before starting option 2, shut down any of the two router ports we configured earlier. Interface fa0/1 preferrably
int fa0/1
shutdown

- Go ahead to create virtual interfaces on the remaining one physical interface.

int fa0/0
no ip address
no shutdown
int fa0/0.10
encapsulation dot1q 10
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
int fa0/0.20
encapsulation dot1q 20
ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0


- Configure SW2 to support inter-VLAN routing
int fa0/1
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk

- Verify the connectivity between the two VLANs

Option 3 - Layers 3 Switch
- We don't need a router for this option. Shutdown the second interface of the router to disconnect.
int f0/0
shutdown

- Configure SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) on SW2 to support inter-VLAN routing between the two VLANs

ip routing
int vlan 10
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
int vlan 20
ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0

- - Verify the connectivity between the two VLANs
