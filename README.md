VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing Lab Project

In this lab, I performed network configuration for an office network which has Tech and Sales departments as the VLANs.
The configuration include Virtual Trunking Protocols (VTP), Access and Trunk Ports and inter-VLAN routing.

This lab project files contain the following:
1. Network diagram
2. VLAN and Inter-LAN lab (PDF file)
3. VLAN configuration commands (.txt file)

The Network diagram displays the schematic representation of the office network.

The VLAN and Inter-VLAN lab PDF file contains the step-by-step process as well as images of the configuration process.

Finally, in the text file I included all the configuration commands used in the lab.

Thanks
