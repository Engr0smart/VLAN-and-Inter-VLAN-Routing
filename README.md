VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing Lab Project

In this lab, I performed configuration for an office network which has Tech and Sales departments as the VLANs.
The lab works include Virtual Trunking Protocols (VTP), Access and Trunk Ports and inter-VLAN routing.

This lab project files contain the following:
1. Network diagram
2. VLAN and Inter-LAN lab (PDF file)
3. VLAN configuration commands (.txt file)
